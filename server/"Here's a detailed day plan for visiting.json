"Here's a detailed day plan for visiting the requested places in San Diego, structured to account for operating hours, travel time, and meal breaks. Please note that Tacos El Gordo (Chula Vista location) is significantly south of the other attractions, leading to substantial driving time. This itinerary is packed and assumes efficient travel and adherence to times.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Traffic:** San Diego traffic can be unpredictable, especially during peak hours. Travel times are estimates and may vary.\n*   **Reservations:** Highly recommend making reservations for **Morning Glory** (especially for weekend brunch) and **The Marine Room** well in advance.\n*   **Parking:** Factor in time for finding parking at each location, particularly in Little Italy, Balboa Park, and La Jolla.\n*   **Flexibility:** This is a tight schedule. Feel free to adjust based on your pace and interests.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"date\": \"Friday, October 27, 2023\",\n  \"places\": [\n    \"Morning Glory\",\n    \"Little Lion Cafe\",\n    \"Harbor Drive Bridge\",\n    \"Balboa Park\",\n    \"Tacos El Gordo\",\n    \"Beach at La Jolla\",\n    \"The Marine Room\"\n  ],\n  \"time\": [\n    \"8:30 AM - 9:45 AM\",\n    \"9:45 AM - 10:15 AM\",\n    \"10:30 AM - 11:00 AM\",\n    \"11:20 AM - 1:20 PM\",\n    \"1:55 PM - 2:55 PM\",\n    \"3:45 PM - 5:15 PM\",\n    \"5:20 PM - 7:20 PM\"\n  ],\n  \"distance\": [\n    \"0.1 miles (walk)\",\n    \"2.5 miles\",\n    \"3.5 miles\",\n    \"12 miles\",\n    \"19 miles\",\n    \"0.5 miles\"\n  ],\n  \"duration\": [\n    \"1 hour 15 min (Breakfast)\",\n    \"30 min (Coffee/Quick Stop)\",\n    \"30 min (Sightseeing)\",\n    \"2 hours (Explore Park)\",\n    \"1 hour (Lunch)\",\n    \"1 hour 30 min (Beach/Cove Exploration)\",\n    \"2 hours (Dinner)\"\n  ],\n  \"total_distance\": \"37.6 miles (total driving/walking distance between locations)\",\n  \"total_duration\": \"10 hours 50 minutes (total plan duration from first activity start to last activity end)\"\n}\n```"
