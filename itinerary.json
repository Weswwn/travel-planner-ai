  "relevantInformation": [
    "This is an extremely packed and ambitious itinerary starting at 8:00 AM and concluding past midnight. Be prepared for a very long day with a lot of movement.",
    "**Alcatraz Island:** Tickets *must* be booked well in advance (often months ahead), and for a specific ferry departure time. We've estimated a 1:30 PM departure for this itinerary, but you'll need to confirm availability and book accordingly.",
    "**San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA):** On December 1, 2025 (a Monday), SFMOMA is typically open from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. This itinerary has you arriving for opening. Please double-check their specific holiday hours or any special closures for that date.",
    "**House of Prime Rib:** Reservations are highly recommended, especially for dinner. Book well in advance to secure your desired time.",
    "**Spark Social:** This is a food truck park, so while it will be a very late lunch (6:05 PM arrival), many trucks operate into the evening. Check specific truck hours closer to your date.",
    "**Mission Dolores Park:** Your visit to Mission Dolores Park will be after sunset (around 7:15 PM in December), so the scenic views might be limited. It's included for convenience on the route.",
    "**Transportation:** This itinerary assumes you will be primarily using rideshares (Uber/Lyft) or a personal car for efficiency between locations. Walking is suitable for some short segments, especially within Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf.",
    "**Flexibility:** This plan is very tight. Consider which activities are your highest priority in case you need to cut something short or skip an activity to avoid feeling rushed."
